# Java-Projects
This repository consists of a number of small Java projects.

1. Tic Tac Toe (created on April 28, 2025)
This project is a round of Tic Tac Toe between two players.
Each player plays a turn, and the board is printed between turns so that the players can see how the game is going.

As the game goes, the program checks whether there is a winner, or if it is tied between both players.
